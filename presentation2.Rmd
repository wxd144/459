# Background

---

IL-2 was injected into those in the Intervention Arm in addition to Antiretroviral Therapy
Control Group was just Antiretroviral Therapy

--

IL-2 increases CD4 count which should decrease the HIV viral load

--

- Is there a difference in the mean profiles of HIV viral load between the two trial arms?

- Is there a significantly different odds of not getting a detectable HIV viral load between the two trial arms?

       x = "id", 
       y = "counts") +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 3.1, col = "red")
```

--

The plot shows the missingness of each individual. Each id should have 9 complete viral load measurements. Here, I set the threadhold as n = 3. For individual has 3 or less recorded measurements will be excluded from the analysis.

---

# Check for missingness continued 

```{r echo=FALSE}
hiv_spread %>% filter(is.na(`30`)) %>% group_by(id)
```

--

- Here, we can see that the individuals excluded from analysis are severe cases. I think here we have sufficient reasons to assume that these individal have died or dropped out. There is no reason to impute these large numbers. 

--

- The drawback is that group B has 5 excluded and A has 1. That might cause problems in the following analysis.

---
# Summary statistics before transformation

```{r echo=FALSE}
hivfu_raw %>% group_by(wknumc) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(rtpcrnih),
            median = median(rtpcrnih),
            mean = mean(rtpcrnih),
            max = max(rtpcrnih),
            missing = 58 - n()) 
```

--

Here, the untransformed mean is much larger than median. We can tell that the distribution of viral load is right skewed. 

---

# Summary statistics after transformation

```{r echo=FALSE}
hivfu_raw %>% group_by(wknumc) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(log(rtpcrnih)),
            median = median(log(rtpcrnih)),
            mean = mean(log(rtpcrnih)),
            max = max(log(rtpcrnih)),
            missing = 58 - n()) 
```
--

The mean and median after log transformation are much closer to each other than untransformed. This indicates that a log transformation is a better option.

FCS Multiple Imputation Predictive Mean Matching was selected


Imputed on Long Data (Time, Log Viral Load, Group)

We do not have to assume MCAR, a strong assumption that may not be plausible

# Strategy for imputation

--

- Delete patient with 3 or less repeated measurements(6 patients)

--

- I assume the NAs after 49 are still 49. (patients don't show up once their conditions get better)

--

- Log transform the viral load.

--

- Multiple impulation to the missing values.

Determining whether or not Interaction Term is Required

LRT performed
--

 With Interaction    1863.6

--

Without Interaction  1857.5

--

With a difference of 6.1 and df = 1, Interaction term is required in the model (0.01352)

---

Determining whether or not the random slope is required

LRT performed

--

 With Slope        1863.6
 
--

 Without Slope  1863.6

--

It would seem that there is no significant difference between the models. Model with slope has better R2, but the Model without the slope has a better AIC and BIC.

# Summary

Research Question

- Does IL-2(grp A) has an significant effect on HIV viral load("rtpcrnih") than control group(grp B) from 14 months post-randomization onwards?

--

We use repeated measures ANOVA, linear mixed effect model and GEE to find out if there is a difference in effect between 2 treatment groups. 

--

All evidence suggests that there is not a significant effect between treatments. 

--

The treatment effect is slightly better for grp A. IL-2(Grp A) does not have an significant effect in reducing HIV viral load from mth 14 to 60 than group B.
